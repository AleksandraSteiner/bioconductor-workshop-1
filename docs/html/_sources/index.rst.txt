Workshop Topics
===============

This workshop, 'Analyses of RNA-seq and ChiP-seq with R/Bioconductor', is designed to introduce attendees to Bioconductor and a variety of its use cases; it is an intermediate-level lecture that presupposes some knowledge of R like that found in our 'Fundamentals of R' workshop.  The topics presented herein include the following:

* Standard analyses for RNA-seq Data
   * Approaches to processing raw data from RNA seq experiments
   * Annotating and importing expression counts
   * Basic exploratory data analysis
   * Assessing model fit and dispersion

* Gene-wise Testing in Depth, Including Multiple Testing
   * Differential expression analysis with the 'edgeR' package
   * Comparison of the 'edgeR' and 'DESeq2' packages for differential expression analysis
   * Hypothesis testing for count data
   * Approaches to multiple hypothesis testing result correction (e.g. false discovery rate calculation)
   * Visualizing differentially expressed genes/transcripts

* Gene Set Analysis
   * Over-representation analysis
   * Gene set enrichment analysis
   * Network-based enrichment analysis
   * Region-based enrichment analysis
   * Resources for these types of analyses (e.g. GO, KEGG, MSigDb)

* Analyses of ChIP-seq Data
   * Introduction to standard approaches used in ChIP Seq
   * Analyses for peak calling
   * Calculation of differential binding across samples
   * The annotation and plotting of peaks



Purpose
=======

This site hosts the Jupyter notebook for the CBC Bioconductor Workshop 1.  The notebook will be served on the web as a static HTML page, meaning that while it looks like a live notebook, it cannot be edited.  To obtain an editable notebook file, please click the respective 'Download Notebook' link.  These four notebooks were created by Vince Carey.
