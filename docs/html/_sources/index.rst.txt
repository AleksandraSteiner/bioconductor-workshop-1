Purpose
=======

This site hosts the Jupyter notebook for the CBC Bioconductor Workshop 1.  The notebook will be served on the web as a static HTML page, meaning that while it looks like a live notebook, it cannot be edited.  To obtain an editable notebook file, please click the respective 'download notebook' link.  These four notebooks were created by Vince Carey.
